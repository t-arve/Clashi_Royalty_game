How to Play
--------------------------------

Clashi Royalty ;3 is a turn-based strategy game inspired by chess, where two players (or one against the AI) compete by summoning custom troops onto a grid battlefield.

Objective
---------
Reduce your opponent’s life to 0 by sending troops to reach and damage their base.

Game Basics
-----------
- Each player starts with 100 life points and 100 gold.
- You can summon troops by spending gold.
- Each troop has specific strength, life, cost, and abilities.
- Gold can be earned by:
    - Defeating enemy troops.
    - Reaching the enemy base with certain units (like King or Queen).

Game Flow
---------
1. Launch the game and choose a mode: Player vs Player, Player vs AI, or Help.
2. On each turn:
    - The active player can summon a new unit by selecting a row.
    - All characters move and attack automatically based on their behavior.
3. The game ends when one player’s life reaches zero.

Troop Types
-----------

| Class   | Role        | Description                                                        |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fighter | Balanced    | A standard unit with average stats and no special effect.          |
| King    | Gold Hunter | Does not attack but has a 50% chance to generate 1–2 gold per turn.|
| Queen   | Thief       | Steals gold from the enemy when attacking or reaching the base.    |
| Tower   | Defender    | Cannot move. High health, good for blocking enemy advances.        |
| Pawn    | Tank        | Attacks the enemy base with 4x damage but moves every other turn.  |
| Joker   | Chaos       | Expensive and unpredictable. Strong but risky to deploy.           |

Tips
----
- Kings and Queens are ideal for generating extra gold.
- Use Towers to delay or block enemy movement.
- Pawns are slow but can deal massive damage to bases.
- Plan troop placement strategically to balance economy, defense, and attack.
